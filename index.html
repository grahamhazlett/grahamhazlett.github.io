            <p>Hi! This is Graham Hazlett's website.</p>
            <p>I'm currently a software engineer at <a href="https://alarm.com/">Alarm.com</a>, developing home security software. I was an engineering student at <a href="https://home.dartmouth.edu/">Dartmouth College</a>.</p>
            <p>I like building things in my spare time. (Some will be documented here, along with other generic blog entries.)</p>
            <p>I've got a deep interest in engineering, aerospace, and technology, and love reading about economics and urban planning. If it flies, drives, or impacts total factor productivity, I'll enjoy learning about it. While I have you here:</p>
